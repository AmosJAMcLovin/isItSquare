// Program Name: Is it a square?
// Program Description: Create a 250 element array and load the array with a series of numbers 
// starting at the first position that is the square of the index. For example, at position 0 would be 0, 
// at position 1 would be 1, at position 2 would be 4, at position 3 would be 9â€¦. Etc.
// Ask the user for a number between 0 and 125,000 and let them know if that number is a square.
// Employ a binary search. Please ensure that the following is completed on both assignments.
